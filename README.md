# Link-prediction-with-similiarity-indices and Neural Networks
     # This project uses a network of criminal organizations with undirected ties. Ties represent positive connections (alliances).
     # We use similarity indices to predict tie formation in the network. 
     # We implement a Neural Network and the Node2Vec algorithm to improve predictions, as well as a k-fold cross-validation procedure to evaluate.
